# 📝 Task Manager API

A robust **Task Manager API** built with **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **Redis**. This API allows users to securely manage tasks with features like **user authentication**, **task creation**, **updating**, **deleting**, and **retrieving** tasks. It also implements **Redis caching** to optimize performance for frequently accessed task data.

## 📌 Project Description

The **Task Manager API** is designed to handle task management efficiently with a scalable and secure backend. Users can register, authenticate using **JWT**, and perform CRUD operations on tasks. 

Key features:
- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up and login with hashed passwords using **bcryptjs**.
- **Task Management**: Create, read, update, and delete tasks.
- **Redis Caching**: Speeds up retrieval by caching tasks based on **priority** and **status**.
- **Environment Configuration**: Uses **dotenv** for managing sensitive information.
- **Error Handling**: Implements centralized error handling for better debugging.
- **Scalable Structure**: Organized in a modular format for easy maintenance and scalability.
